Welcome!
========

Welcome to Pydra's tutorial. The scripts in this section are designed to teach you how to use Pydra. To run the scripts,
you may navigate to the *tutorial* directory in the pydra project of your python IDE.

Alternatively, you can activate activate your ``pydra_env`` environment (see :ref:`installation`), navigate to your
installation of pydra and run a tutorial script from the command line with:

.. code-block::

    python -m pydra.tutorial.<NAME>


Where <NAME> is the name of the script (without the .py extension).

You may also copy and paste the code from the tutorial scripts into your own project and mess around with it to see
what happens - this can be a great way to learn about how some sample code works!
