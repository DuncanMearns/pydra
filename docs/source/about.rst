Pydra - experiment control
==========================

Pydra is a library for building control systems for experimental setups. It allows users to build networks of *workers*
that communicate with each other via *messages* over `ZeroMQ <https://zeromq.org/>`_. It is designed with simplicity,
flexibility and modularity in mind (although it might not always deliver on any or all those fronts...). Pydra also
has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with PyQt.

**Pydra** is a portmanteau of Python and hydra.
