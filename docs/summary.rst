Pydra is a library for building control systems for experimental setups. It allows users to build networks of _workers_
that communicate with each other via messages over `ZeroMQ <https://zeromq.org/>`_. It is designed with simplicity,
flexibility and modularity in mind (although it might not always deliver on any or all those fronts...).

Pydra also provides a Graphical User Interface built with PyQt.

*Pydra* is a portmanteau of Python and hydra.
